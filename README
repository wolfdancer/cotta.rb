Welcome to the Ruby version of the {Cotta file API}[http://cotta.rubyforge.org]

= Mission

Provide a lightweight, simple and sensible API to file operation and testing.
See {Cotta Power}[http://cotta.sourceforge.net/power.html] for its motivation


= Install It

The easiest way to install the install cotta using RubyGems:

  sudo gem install cotta

= Features

Cotta is just a plain Ruby API, so you can use it wherever you can use Ruby.

To used the new API just require the client driver:

   require "rubygems"
   require "cotta"

For a fully backward compatible API you can start with:

   require "rubygems"
   gem "cotta"
   require "cotta"

For instance
to write a little Ruby script using cotta you could write something like:

   #!/usr/bin/env ruby
   #
   # Sample Ruby script using the Cotta API
   #
   require "rubygems"
   gem "cotta", ">=1.0.0"
   require "cotta"
   #system implementation is injected here
   cotta = Cotta::Cotta.new()
   file2 = cotta.file('dir2/file.txt')
   file2.exists?.should_equal false
   # parent directories are created automatically
   @file.save('my content')
   @file.copy_to(file2)
   file2.exists?.should_equal true
   file2.load.should_equal 'my content'
   file2.read {|file| puts file.gets}

= Writing Tests

To test your code that uses Cotta API, you just need to pass in a Cotta instance that is backed by an in-memory
file system: Cotta::Cotta.new(Cotta::InMemorySystem.new)
